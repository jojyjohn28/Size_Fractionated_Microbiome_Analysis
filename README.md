#### 🧬 Size_Fractionated_Microbiome_Analysis

**An ongoing, step-by-step bioinformatics workflow for analyzing size-fractionated microbial communities (Particle-Attached vs Free-Living) using shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics.**

This repository documents the **analysis day by day**, following real research progress rather than a polished, post-hoc pipeline.
I update this README daily as new steps, scripts, and results are added.

##### 🎯 Project Goals

Compare Particle-Attached (PA) vs Free-Living (FL) microbial communities

**Quantify:**

1. Taxonomic composition (total & active communities)

2. Functional potential (DNA)

3. Functional activity (RNA)

**Integrate:**

1. Read-based profiling

2. Functional annotation

3. Ecological statistics

4. Co-occurrence and redundancy analyses

#### 🔜 Upcoming Steps (Planned)

1. Day 4: Total vs Active community comparisons (DNA vs RNA)

2. Day 5: Functional profiling using CAZymes & transporters

3. Day 6: Non-redundant gene catalog construction

4. Day 7: DNA:RNA ratios and activity-based niche modeling

5. Day 8: Co-occurrence networks (season, bay, fraction)

6. Day 9: Functional redundancy modeling

**(Timeline may adapt as analysis evolves — this reflects real research, not a fixed tutorial.)**
