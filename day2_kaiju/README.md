#### Size-Fractionated Microbiome Analysis — Day 2

####Kaiju Classification and Extraction of Bacterial & Archaeal Reads

This folder contains all materials related to **Day 2** of the _Size-Fractionated Microbiome Analysis_ series.

On Day 2, we move from clean metagenomic reads to **protein-level taxonomic classification** using **Kaiju**, followed by extraction of **Bacterial and Archaeal reads** for downstream analyses.

### 🎯 Goals of Day 2

- Classify shotgun metagenomic reads using Kaiju
- Generate taxonomy summary tables suitable for visualization
- Visualize community composition at higher taxonomic ranks

### 📂 Contents

- **`Kaiju_data_jojy.xlsx`**  
  Processed Kaiju summary table used for plotting
- **`kaiju_visulization_jj.R`**  
  R script for stacked bar plots and relative abundance visualizations
- for details about Kaiju Run; please see: https://jojyjohn28.github.io/blog/size-fractionated-microbiome-analysis-day2/

This is an **ongoing project**, and files may be updated as analyses progress.
