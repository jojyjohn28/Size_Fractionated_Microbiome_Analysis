#### Size-Fractionated Microbiome Analysis — Day 3

#### Species-Level Profiling with mOTUs (Work in Progress)

This directory corresponds to **Day 3** of the _Size-Fractionated Microbiome Analysis_ series, focusing on **species-level profiling of shotgun metagenomes using mOTUs**.

At this stage, the analysis is **actively in progress**, and files will be added incrementally as workflows for **total (DNA)** and **active (RNA)** community profiling are finalized.

### 🎯 Scope of Day 3–4

- Species-level taxonomic profiling using **mOTUs v3**
- Parallel analysis of:
  - **Total community (metagenomes)**
  - **Active community (metatranscriptomes)**
- Comparison of DNA vs RNA signals across:
  - Free-living (FL)
  - Particle-attached (PA) fractions
- Integration with downstream visualization and ecological analyses

### 📌 Current Status

- mOTUs profiling and batch processing completed
- Manual merging and normalization of profiles underway
- Visualization and comparative analyses in ongoing

### 📖 Blog Post

A detailed walkthrough of the Day 3 analysis, including methods, scripts, and figures, is available here:

### 🔜 What’s Coming Next

- Finalized mOTUs merged tables
- DNA vs RNA comparisons (Day 4)
- Integration with functional profiling and redundancy analyses

This README will be updated as new files and results are added.
